## Introduction
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on common characteristics. This project aims to perform customer segmentation using various machine learning techniques to help businesses understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:
1. Data collection and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Feature engineering and selection.
4. Application of clustering algorithms.
5. Evaluation of clustering results.
6. Visualization of segments.
7. Interpretation of the segments and business insights.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains information about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and other relevant attributes. The data is stored in a excel file named `ecom customer_data.xlsx`.

### Data Attributes:
- `Cust_ID`: Unique customer ID
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Order`: Orders made by the customer
- `...`: Additional features relevant to the analysis

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones for clustering.
4. **Clustering Algorithms**: Applying K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and other techniques.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using silhouette score, elbow method, and other metrics to evaluate the clustering results.
6. **Visualization**: Plotting clusters and their characteristics to interpret the results.

## Results
The results of the customer segmentation analysis are summarized in the following ways:
- Description of each customer segment.
- Visualizations of clusters.
- Business insights derived from the segments.

## Contributing
